# Template audio brief

## Direction

- Warm, low-key, optimistic utility music: 68 BPM, major-seventh harmony,
  rounded sine/triangle plucks, generous rests, and low playback levels.
- Explicit exclusions: beating drones, constant bass pressure, buzzy square
  waves, sharp highs, vocals, fake orchestration, and dense repetition.
- Designed first for phone speakers, then headphones, in portrait play.

## Music states

- Menu: four sparse notes per eight-step phrase over a quiet chord-cycle bass.
- Gameplay: the same identity with a slightly fuller motif; no hard transition.
- Pause/sleep/background: stop scheduling and suspend the shared audio context.
- Resume: restart from the current harmonic step after the context resumes.
- Ad presentation: the RUN facade explicitly suspends the shared audio context
  around rewarded and interstitial SDK calls because ads do not reliably emit
  lifecycle callbacks. Returning from an ad resumes only when the player has
  not muted the relevant channel and the app is not otherwise paused/hidden.
- Music is procedural and local. It uses no generated asset, RUN credits, or
  external license.

## Feedback map

| Moment | Sound | Haptic | Required visual feedback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UI tap | soft sine tick | light when supported/enabled | pressed/focus state |
| Start | short rising triangle | light | phase transition |
| Bounce | quiet rounded ping, rate-limited | none | movement, score, particles |
| Reward/milestone | rising consonant cue | success | reward state/effect |
| Failure/unavailable | falling soft cue | warning/error where appropriate | status copy/toast |

Every cue has a cooldown and short envelope. Oscillators disconnect after they
end, and the master bus has conservative dynamics compression.

## Settings and accessibility

- Separate persisted Music and SFX toggles/volumes; defaults are 42% and 70%.
- Haptics have a separate persisted toggle and are never the only signal.
- There is no voice or standalone ambience bus in this content-neutral starter.
- Audio unlock is recoverable after a player gesture; reduced motion does not
  remove audio controls or non-motion outcome feedback.

## QA

- The development `?qa=1` contract reports context state, scheduler state,
  active music/SFX voices, scheduled notes, and suppressed rapid cues.
- Verify first unlock, Music/SFX off independently, repeated bounce limits,
  pause/resume, background/foreground, ad open/close (including closing while
  the app is paused), reload persistence, and phone/headphone mix in every
  derived game.
